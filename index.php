		<h3>Web development optimized for performance.</h3>
		<p>
			Hello! I'm Julie and I'm a front end web developer. From family owned restaurants to international corporations, I deliver functional and usable sites to every client.
		</p>
		<p>
			I code strong semantic HTML5, performant CSS3, and clean, well-documented JavaScript. My sites are responsive, consistent across platforms, and built to the latest web standards.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love my work, and Iâ€™m ready for new challenges.
